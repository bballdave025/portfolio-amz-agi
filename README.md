# portfolio-amz-agi
Portfolio set up to go along with application for Amazon AI Content Expert II, Job ID 3045592. Made to showcase how my skills align with the job description.

## Ready for a Rebuild (Like those old, Under Construction, banners that used to be on some websites). ETA, 2025-09-10 at 08:00:00 MDT

## Regex + UNIX test tooling

Have a look at [this regex (and UNIX) showcase](https://github.com/bballdave025/portfolio-amz-agi/blob/main/isolated_examples/regex_showcase.md)

## Familiarity with Python CLI

Ever wondered which elements can be spelled with the element symbols? Look at the `README` for [`mendeleev-spelling-bee`](https://github.com/bballdave025/mendeleev-spelling-bee).

## LLM Familiarity

Have a look at my work with RWKV and LoRA. RWKV is a RNN-based LLM that has shown promise in providing transormer-LLM-like results. Here, I go through an attempted proof of concept.

Also, look at my notes about doing some incremental CoT prompting to build a Cyrillic-based chemical-element list with one-to-one mapping, cultural sensitivity, and a lot of fun.

## JSON/CSV/Markdown/HTML/XML fluency

Look at the [same file]() showcased in Regex + Unix. I had to get creative to get the colors working right. (For a previous attempt at color with a similar sequence of `bash` commands,
have a look [here]()
